The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern where:

An object can be called as the subject, maintains a list of its dependnts called
observers
when the subject state changes,
all its observers are notified automataclly

very simple real-world example is:

YouTube Channel = Subject

Subscribers = Observers
